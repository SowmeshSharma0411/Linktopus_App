**Flutter Development Intern, Intecc**

Provided methodologies for object-orientated software development and efficient database design for an early-release version of an ed-tech app and a Full-Stack Flutter App called *Linktopus*. We used Flutter and Firebase - Firestore, FirebaseAuth, and Google Cloud Storage for the project.

Key Accomplishments:

●	Designed an intuitive front end with dynamic bottom navigation drawers, pop-ups, and interactive buttons with responsive layouts and utilized an Object-Oriented approach to development along with MVC.

●	Designed the backend functional support for the profile page using Firebase storage and Firestore, while using the Firebase login ID as the doc ID.

●	Also designed a system that automates sending tailored job applications by fetching resumes from Firebase and redirecting them to Gmail for completion.
